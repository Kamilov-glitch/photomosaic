Hi, hello there!

Current project is about creating photomosaic cretor. Photomosaics are - big pictures built out of thousands of other tiny pictures. Basically what I have to do is:

- Make an interface to upload picture
- Take that uploaded pic and place it
- Pixelate it
- Check the average color of certain pixel
- Find a pic that has an average color similar to that pixel
- Change that pixel with that image
- Do that to all pixels
- Profit??
